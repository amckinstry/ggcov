How To Install and Configure the Ggcov Web Pages
================================================

The ggcov web pages are a set of PHP code which generate a small
set of interconnected interactive HTML pages which allow a user
to explore test code coverage data using a standard Web browser.

Browser Compatibility
---------------------

The ggcov PHP pages are compliant HTML4 and (currently) use no
Javascript.  They have only been tested on the Mozilla Firefox
browser, but are designed to be browser agnostic and should work in
any standards- compliant browser.  I don't know whether they will
work in MSIE.

Server Compatibility
--------------------

The ggcov PHP pages require a web server which

*  supports PHP version 4.3 or later, and

*  provides the dba extension with the db4 provider (which
   ggcov uses to read the intermediate database), and

*  provides the gd extension (which ggcov uses to generate
   the bargraphs on the Summary page).

The intermediate database format is designed to be platform-
independant so that the web server can be a different platform to
the development machine.  The pages are intended to be compatible
with both PHP 4.3 and PHP 5.

The pages have been tested using PHP 4.3.9 and Apache 2.0
on an i386 Linux machine.

Installing, If You Control the Web Server
-----------------------------------------

If you control the web server, i.e. you have the ability to
install software, installation should be easy.

1.  install the ggcov-web RPM, e.g.
    www# rpm -Uvh ggcov-web-fc3-0.4-1.i386.rpm

2.  copy the file /usr/share/doc/ggcov-web-VERSION/ggcov.conf
    into the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory (Apache 2) or insert
    the contents into httpd.conf (Apache 1.3).

3.  restart the web server, e.g.
    www# service httpd restart

4.  install one or more tests in subdirectories of /var/ggcov/web/tests/, e.g.
    dev$ ggcov-webdb *.c
    dev$ scp ggcov.webdb.tgz root@www:/tmp
    web# cd /var/ggcov/web/tests
    web# mkdir foo ; cd foo
    web# tar -xzf /tmp/ggcov.webdb.tgz

5.  point your browser at http://yourserver.com/ggcov/

Note that the web pages do not need write permission for any files in
the test directories; the test data is completely read-only.

Installing, If You Don't Control the Web Server
-----------------------------------------------

This technique works when you don't control the web server but you
do have a shell account and control over some subset of the web site.
For the purposes of this example let's assume you are a developer on
a sourceforge.net project called "foobar".

1.  from the ggcov build directory, install the PHP files into
    a directory you own which is outside the directory visible
    to the web server, e.g.
    
    shell$ cd software/ggcov-0.4/
    shell$ cd php ; make phpdir=/home/groups/f/fo/foobar/php install
    
2.  the subset of those files which need to be seen by the web server
    are located in the www/ subdirectory, so move, copy or link those
    into the directory the web server sees, e.g.
    
    shell$ cd /home/groups/f/fo/foobar/htdocs
    shell$ ln -s ../php/www/ ggcov
    
3.  configure the PHP include path and the ggcov test directory
    by adding a .htaccess file to the www/ directory, e.g.
    
    shell$ cd /home/groups/f/fo/foobar/php/www
    shell$ cat > .htaccess <EOF
    DirectoryIndex tests.php
    php_value include_path /home/groups/f/fo/foobar/php/include
    php_value ggcov.basic_test_dir /home/groups/f/fo/foobar/tests
    EOF
    
4.  install one or more tests in subdirectories of
    /home/groups/f/fo/foobar/tests, e.g.
    dev$ ggcov-webdb *.c
    dev$ scp ggcov.webdb.tgz shell.sourceforge.net:
    shell$ cd /home/groups/f/fo/foobar/tests
    shell$ mkdir foo ; cd foo
    shell$ tar -xzf ~/ggcov.webdb.tgz

5.  point your browser at http://foobar.sourceforget.net/ggcov/
