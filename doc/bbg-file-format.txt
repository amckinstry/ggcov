LUINT32 is a little-endian 32 bit unsigned integer
LUINT64 is a little-endian 64 bit unsigned integer

Read LUINT32s from the .da file in this order:
(ignoring the first LUINT64 which is a count of the LUINT64s following)

foreach function in .bbg file
    foreach block in function->blocks
	foreach arcs in block->outarcs where !arc->on_tree
	    LUINT64 arc_count
