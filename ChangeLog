	* Release 0.0.7.

	* Builds a callgraph from the information read from various files,
	including calls to functions not covered (like printf).
	* Added a window to explore the call graph.  Shows distribution to
	callers and callees in clists; double-clicking navigates to the
	new function.
	* Added a Calls window which shows the call coverage per-call
	for a given function.
	* Ggcov uses the BFD library to read object files, using relocs,
	contents and symbols for text sections to figure out names
	for function call arcs in the block graph.
	* Added option to Source window to show block numbers.
	* Added ulcmp() and ullcmp() to help sorting on unsigned longs
	and unsigned long longs respectively.
	* Renamed xmalloc() -> gnb_xmalloc() to avoid possible clash
	with function of same name in -liberty.
	* Added ui_combo_set_current_data().
	* Added listclear() macro which deletes GList structures like listdelete()
	but does not call any dtor.
	* Fixed a few minor problems with debugging prints and warnings.

Fri Nov 30 12:26:55 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.6
	* Added a Files List window analagous to the Function List window.
	* Added fixed Windows menu items to create new Summary, Source, File
	List and Function List windows.
	* Initial window population is now just an overall summary.
	* Sortable column support now handles the case where not every column
	is sortable (backport from ggui).
	* Added a TODO list of some ideas.

Tue Nov 27 11:53:14 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.5
	* Added progress bars to show test coverage stats in the Summary window.
	* Progress bars display red/green to color code coverage stats.
	Had to subclass from GtkProgressBar to achieve this.
	* Added a Functions List window to show all the functions in all
	the files, with line call and branch coverage results.  Clicking
	on columns sorts the list by that column.  Double-clicking on
	rows shows the source for that function.
	* Added support for having an up or down arrow in the current sort
	column of a clist.  Clicking on the columns does the expected
	thing with sorting.

Sun Nov 25 19:44:38 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.4
	* Added GUI to show summary of coverage statistics at
