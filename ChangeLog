	* Release 0.0.6
	* Added a Files List window analagous to the Function List window.
	* Added fixed Windows menu items to create new Summary, Source, File
	List and Function List windows.
	* Initial window population is now just an overall summary.
	* Sortable column support now handles the case where not every column
	is sortable (backport from ggui).
	* Added a TODO list of some ideas.

	* Release 0.0.5
	* Added progress bars to show test coverage stats in the Summary window.
	* Progress bars display red/green to color code coverage stats.
	Had to subclass from GtkProgressBar to achieve this.
	* Added a Functions List window to show all the functions in all
	the files, with line call and branch coverage results.  Clicking
	on columns sorts the list by that column.  Double-clicking on
	rows shows the source for that function.
	* Added support for having an up or down arrow in the current sort
	column of a clist.  Clicking on the columns does the expected
	thing with sorting.
