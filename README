This is a simple GUI for browsing C test coverage data gathered
by programs instrumented with "gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage".
Hence it's a graphical replacement for the "gcov" program that
comes with gcc.

I wrote this program because I was sick of crappy text mode coverage
results, having been spoilt some years earlier by the PureCoverage GUI.

To use ggcov, invoke it with one or more .c filenames.  It will
find and read the .bb, .bbg, and .da files in the same directory as
the .c files, and display data for you.  You can also invoke ggcov
with a directory name; ggcov will apply itself to all the .c files
in that directory.  Finally, you can mix multiple directories and
.c file names.

GGcov has three windows:

Summary
    presents a test coverage summary at one of four scopes: overall,
    file, function, or range of lines in a file.  Note that the
    range of lines can span function boundaries.
    
Function List
    presents a list of all functions in the covered files, with their
    coverage statistics.  The list can be sorted by line coverage,
    call coverage and branch coverage.
    
Source
    presents the source of a covered file, annotated with source line
    numbers and source line execution counts.  Lines can be colour
    coded according to whether they have been covered.
