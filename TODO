x  Handle reading callgraph data from .o files generated by C++
   programs, by matching mangled names from the .o with unmangled
   names in the .bb file.
   
x  On platforms which attempt to load object files, fail gracefully
   when object files are missing.  Count the number of missing
   object files, issue a warning to the user if it's non-zero.
   
x  Add an option to do a recursive find of source files instead of
   a local find, e.g. "ggcov -r dir" being equivalent to
   "ggcov $(find dir -type f -name '*.[cC]')"

x  Annotate source with per-function coverage summaries.  The challenge
   is that this breaks the identity between source code line and text
   widget line.

x  Annotate blocks with call and branch stats.

x  Show block boundaries in the Source window using one of:
   1. drawn rectangles with block number labelled, or
   2. 4-colour mapping, or
   3. a column showing block numbers(s) -- clicking on a block
      number selects the block.
   
x  Add a column to the Source window showing a comma-seperated list
   of block execution counts for each line.
   
x  Provide a menu command to export the file and function lists and
   summaries to useful formats, e.g. CSV, XML, Excel spreadsheet.
   
x  Add to the Properties window a list of filename and function name
   patterns to ignore, e.g. ignore functions matching "_GLOBAL_*".

x  Add to the Properties window an option to control display of
   filenames: full, basename, or minimal (default, dynamically calculated
   minimal unique trailing subset of path components).

x  Extend colour coding to all the places where a percentage, fraction,
   or count of coverage is shown, especially the appropriate columns in
   the Calls, Files and Functions windows.  Also the labels in the
   Summary window.
   
x  Handle the boundary case of the last block in a function properly.

x  In the Source window, show branches graphically, as drawn arrows
   (labelled with branch probablities) from one block to another.
   
x  Option to watch mtimes of .da files and reload them when they
   change, so that user can watch coverage stats update in realtime
   as their testsuite is run.
   
x  Option to aggregate coverage stats from multiple runs (multiple
   sets of .da files in separate directories).
   
x  In the Summary window, typing into the entry or popped-up list
   of the filename and function name combo boxes should seek in
   the list.

x  Add a menu command to the Source window to go to a specific line.

x  Add a menu command to the Source window to search for patterns.

x  Additional source annotations in the Source window (i.e. non-column
   additions like per-function stats) should be colour coded to
   make them distinct from non-executable lines of source.
   
x  Add column titles to Source window, with the ability to hide them,
   visible by default, state saved automatically.
   
x  Merge the Line column in the Calls window into the Call From column,
   so it's expressed as "function:line".

x  Make the default widths of the columns in the Call List window wide
   enough to actually show the label.

x  ??? Add a Weighted Sum to the Summary Overall window.

x  Arrows appear in all the sortable column titles...they should appear
   only in the current sort column.
   
x  Handle shared libraries...scan the .dynamic structure of the executable
   for runtime path and list of sonames, resolve each, and recursively
   scan them for coveraged source files.
   
x  ??? Minimise filenames only within the context of a program or library?

x  ??? Add option to only coverage shared libraries and ignore programs.

--- CLOSED ---

x  Implement the -o option of gcov which specifies a directory in
   which .bb .bbg and .da files are found (also .o for ggcov).
   
x  Add menu item to Source window to save the text with annotations.

x  Reorganise the text widget of the Source window so that there are
   (passive) column headers like a clist.  May require some trickery,
   even writing a new widget.  It might be useful to use multiple
   text widgets side by side to implement columns.
   
x  Add a menu command to the Source window to go to the Summary
   window for that source file.
   
x  Add a menu command to the Source window to go to the Summary
   window for the function containing the first selected line.

x  Add a menu command to the Source window to go to the Summary
   window for the range of selected lines.

x  Add a View menu to the Calls List window, with at least the ability
   to show/hide the various columns in the list and the colour coding.
   Column "Arc" to be hidden by default.

x  In the Source window, deal with large Filenames and Functions menus
   by splitting them up, like maketool's targets menu.  Or make them
   comboboxes in a toolbar, which would probably be easier.

x   Callgraphwin should label the two lists something easier to
    understand.  Instead of "Distibution to Ancestors" something like
    "Called From".

x  Colour code red/green the entries in the Function List, Calls List
   etc windows.
   
x  Colour-code the coverage stats cells in the Function List and
   File List windows.
   
x  Preferences window pane to control colour coding colours.

x  Added a Properties window which allows the user to control the
   colours used for colour coding.

x  Add to the Properties window an option to re-use the same Source
   window instead of popping up new ones all the time.

x  Source files found by all techniques should generate full pathnames,
   including especially cov_read_directory() and cov_read_source_file().   

x  cov_file_t are kept in a hashtable, and the only standard iteration
   mechanism uses this hashtable, which is very clunky as it requires
   passing a function pointer to be called for every cov_file_t. OTOH
   there is a global alphabetically sorted list of minimal file names.
   Replace that global list of filenames with a static member list of
   cov_file_t, sorted in alphabetical minimal file name order, built
   in cov_post_read.  Replace the clunky iteration interface with a
   list iterator over that list.

x   Rename Windows->New Call Graph to Windows->New Call Butterfly and
    Windows->New Call Graph2 to Windows->New Call Tree.
    
x  Calls List window should have an "All Functions" entry in the
   Function combo box.  This should be the first and default entry.
   
x  Add another column to the Calls List window, so it has both From
   and To function names.
   
x  Double-clicking on rows in the Calls List window should show the
   source for that call.
   
x  Add a "Files List" window analagous to the existing "Functions List"
   window: shows list of all filenames, with columns for various test
   coverage stats, all columns sortable.  Double-clicking on a filename
   pops up a Source window for that file.

x  Add menu commands to the Windows menu to create new Summary window
   etc, and replace all the initial startup windows with just an
   overall Summary.

x  Try to correlate the call numbers from blocks with function symbols
   by looking up ELF relocs and debug line number records in the object
   files using the BFD library.  For each reloc, reloc -> address ->
   linenumber -> block(s).  May be tricky, especially when blocks
   overlap on a line.
   
x  Add Help->About, Help->Licence etc menu commands.

x  Add icon.

x   The File->Close and File->Exit callbacks in each window can now be
    made unique, as there is a virtual window_t dtor to enable correct
    cleaning up.
