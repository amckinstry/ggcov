x  Need a decent string array class.

x  Reimplement file_normalise and file_make_absolute using
   a string array class.  Possibly wrap those up in a pathname
   class.

x  Make the --disable-crash-dialog commandline option work

x  Fix assert failures or otherwise in Call Butterfly and
   Call Graph windows when test014's bar.c is loaded without
   foo.c.

x  File->Open dialog needs to allow user to select a directory
   recursively like the --recursive commandline option.

x  Need a menu command to spawn a new ggcov, and/or one to forget
   all data.

x  Split out the i386 and DWARF specific code into separate source
   files chosen from configure.in so that multiple targets can be
   supported.  Use the full autoconf magic to allow for cross-ggcov.

x  Add a menu command to the Source window to go to a specific line.

x  Add a menu command to the Source window to search for patterns.

x  Merge the Line column in the Calls window into the Call From column,
   so it's expressed as "function:line".

x  Make the default widths of the columns in the Call List window wide
   enough to actually show the label.

x  ??? Add a Weighted Sum to the Summary Overall window.

x  Arrows appear in all the sortable column titles...they should appear
   only in the current sort column.
      
x  ??? Add option to only coverage shared libraries and ignore programs.
