%description
Ggcov is a simple GUI program for browsing test coverage data
from C programs, and is intended to be a graphical replacement
for the gcov program.

Test coverage data is produced by programs which have been built
with "gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage", and indicate how
many times each line and branch has been executed, cumulatively
over multiple test runs.
